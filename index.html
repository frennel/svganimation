             <p><b>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 7,000 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era — and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth’s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives. <br>
			 <img class = "pic1" src = "pic1.svg" ><br>
			 <i>Here are some of its reasons: </i>
			 <ul>
				<li> Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel burning power plants.
				<li> Emissions from burning gasoline for transportation.
				<li> Deforestation (tropical forests for wood, pulp, and farmland).
				<li> Increase in usage of chemical fertilizers on croplands.
				<li> Methane emissions from animals, agriculture such as rice paddies, and from Arctic seabeds.
			</ul></b></p>

				<li> Ice is melting worldwide, especially at the Earth’s poles. This includes mountain glaciers, ice sheets covering West Antarctica and Greenland, and Arctic sea ice.
				<br><li> Researcher Bill Fraser has tracked the decline of the Adélie penguins on Antarctica, where their numbers have fallen from 32,000 breeding pairs to 11,000 in 30 years.
				<li> Sea level rise became faster over the last century.
				<li> Precipitation (rain and snowfall) has increased across the globe, on average
				<li> Floods and droughts will become more common. Rainfall in Ethiopia, where droughts are already common, could decline by 10 percent over the next 50 years.

			 <h3><small>According to recent studies: </small></h3>
             <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspContinuing a string of global heat records, last month was the hottest July ever recorded, NASA said. But the agency added a wrinkle: Because July is always the hottest month of the year, this July was the hottest of any month since adequate record-keeping began in 1880. The recent El Niño contributed to the record, as did overall warming linked to greenhouse gas emissions. El Niño, in which sea surface temperatures rise in the eastern Pacific, has now ended.</p>

			 <p><i>Climate change is never going to announce itself by name. But this is what we should expect it to look like.</i><br><br>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThat’s what many scientists, analysts and activists are saying after heavy rains in southern Louisiana have killed at least 11 people and forced tens of thousands of residents from their homes, in the latest in a series of extreme floods that have occurred in the United States over the last two years.
