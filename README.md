# svganimation

This is my SVG Web Animation project. This repository contains the source code for a fully animated website built exclusively using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and web animation techniques. This project demonstrates the power and versatility of SVG combined with modern web animation to create an engaging and dynamic user experience.

Features:
- Pure SVG Graphics: All visual elements are created using SVG, ensuring crisp and scalable graphics on any device.
- Smooth Animations: Leveraging CSS and JavaScript, the website features seamless animations that enhance the user experience without compromising performance.

Technologies Used:
- HTML5: For the basic structure of the website.
- CSS3: For styling and animations.
- SVG: For all graphical content.
